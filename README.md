## LIPTV File Guide
I have many files in this repo. It might be confusing, so here are what the files are.

### Video.html, Video2.html
These are test files I've made before. Ignore them.

### video3.html
The main file for LIPTV. Open this file to start LIPTV.

### audio.html
An internet radio stream interface. It's really misplaced, and I'll work on it later.
