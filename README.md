# LIPTV
###### Legal IPTV - Spinoff of LegalStream

LIPTV is an HTML interface for my LegalStream playist. So far, I've only ported my news and SD tech streams, but coming up next are Sports and Christian channels.

## LIPTV File Guide
I have many files in this repo. It might be confusing, so here are what the files are.

### Video.html, Video2.html
These are test files I've made before ignore them.

### video3.html
The main file for LIPTT open this file to start LIPTV.

### audio.html
An internet radio stream interface. It's really misplaced, and I'll work on it later.
